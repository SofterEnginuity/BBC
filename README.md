## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This one was build from scratch as well, but was a bit more challenging as there were a lot more media queries involved to get the responsive design that I was going for. 

## Lessons Learned:

A lot of times, projects are easier said than done. While this is one of my favorite projects, it was also one of my more challenging ones, as I used only used floats.
